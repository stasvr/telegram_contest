      <p>Best-known for hits including Welcome To The Black Parade, Teenagers and Helena, My Chemical Romance are an alternative rock band founded in New Jersey in 2001.</p>
      <p>Announcing their break-up in 2013, the band said in a statement: “We’ve gotten to go places we never knew we would.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been able to see and experience things we never imagined possible. We’ve shared the stage with people we admire, people we look up to, and best of all our friends.</p>
      <p>“And now, like all great things, it has come time for it to end.”</p>
      <p>Since going their separate ways, band members including Frank Iero, Ray Toro and Mikey Way have pursued other musical projects.</p>
      <p>Frontman Gerard Way created the comic book series The Umbrella Academy, which was adapted into a major Netflix TV series starring Ellen Page earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Tickets for the reunion show, set to take place at Los Angeles’ Shrine Expo Hall on December 20, go on sale on November 1.</p>
